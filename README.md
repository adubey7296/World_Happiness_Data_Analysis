# World_Happiness_Data_Analysis

Analyzing the World Happiness Report dataset. The purpose of this project is to exercise and demonstrate acquired abilities. Should the person who is looking at this analysis have any questions or suggestions, do not hesitate to contact me.

# The Data
Our dataset is the 2017 World Happiness Report published by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network. This data was collected by the Gallup World Poll, using a set of surveys from more than 160 countries in over 140 languages. The surveys aim to analyze data from hundreds of thousands of individuals and investigate the ways in which elements of peopleâ€™s working lives drive their wellbeing.

Each country is given a happiness score that is the sum of scores from the following 7 criteria:

GDP per capita healthy years of life expectancy, social support (as measured by having someone to count on in times of trouble), trust (as measured by a perceived absence of corruption in government and business) perceived freedom to make life decisions generosity (as measured by recent donations) dystopia (benchmark country corresponding to the lowest possible values in each of the criteria) The countries are then ranked from most happy to least happy.

Additionally, the report contains information about job satisfaction in each country.

# Tasks performed:
# A. Importing, cleaning and numerical summaries
Download the data set data.csv from the Resources tab.
Import the data as a pandas DataFrame.
Check the number of observations.
Obtain the column headings.
Check the data type for each column.
Check if there are any missing values.
If necessary remove any observations to ensure that there are no missing values and the values in each column are of the same data type.
Obtain the mean, minimum and maximum value for each column containing numerical data.
List the 10 happiest countries.
List the 10 least happy countries.
# B. Indexing and grouping
Use the column 'Region' to create a separate DataFrame containing the data points from each of the six regions: North America, Latin America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia Pacific, Africa.
Compute the mean happiness score for each region and rank the regions from most happy to least happy.
Compute the number of countries in each region that have a happiness score above 6.0.
Compute the difference between the maximum and minimum happiness score for each region. Which region has the largest range of happiness scores?
# C. Bar plot of the Happiness Score
Obtain a horizontal bar plot of the Happiness Score of the top 10 countries. Your bar chart should have the names of the countries are listed vertically along the y-axis and the x-axis should have labels for each number from 0 to 8. Ensure that the chart has an appropriate title and labels.
You will now modify the bar chart you obtained in step 1 to turn into a stacked bar chart where the overall happiness score is divided into the seven parts corresponding to the columns:
Economy
Family
Health
Freedom
Generosity
Corruption
Dystopia Choose a distinct color for each category and include an appropriate legend with your chart.
Obtain the same stacked horizontal bar chart as in step 2 but this time instead of the top 10 countries consider all countries from the region Africa.
# D. Pairwise Scatter plots
Obtain scatter plots of the Happiness Score versus each of the other variables. Your plots should be displayed as multiple plots table and obtained with one command as supposed to separate commands for each plot.
# E. Correlation
Obtain the correlation between the Happiness Score and each of the other variables. Which variable has the highest correlation with the Happiness Score?
